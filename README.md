# PhD-code

The purpose of this codebase is to make available some of the work I was doing on numerical solutions to
integro-differential equations that arise in symplectic geometry.  All of the code you'll find here is in MATLAB.
I don't claim to know MATLAB anymore, and if I were to do this again, I would probably use C++.  This code was
written before I had developed any maturity as a developer; as such, the entire repository is a tangled mess of 
ad-hoc scripts with no semblance of organization.
